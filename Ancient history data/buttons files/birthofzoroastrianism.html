            <p>Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, was founded by the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) in ancient Persia, around the 6th century BCE. It introduced the concept of a single god, Ahura Mazda, who represents all that is good, opposing the evil spirit Angra Mainyu.</p>

            <p>The teachings of Zoroastrianism are compiled in the *Avesta*, the religion's sacred text, which emphasizes truth, righteousness, and the duality of good and evil. The religion also introduced the idea of an eternal afterlife, with judgment based on one's deeds in life.</p>
