            <p>Confucianism and Daoism, two of the most influential philosophical traditions in Chinese history, originated during the turbulent Warring States period (475â€“221 BCE). These philosophies offered different solutions to the chaos, shaping Chinese culture, governance, and spiritual thought for centuries.</p>

            <p>Daoism, attributed to the sage Laozi, contrasts Confucianism by focusing on harmony with nature and the Dao ("The Way"). Its teachings, encapsulated in the *Tao Te Ching*, advocate simplicity, spontaneity, and a profound connection to the natural world.</p>
