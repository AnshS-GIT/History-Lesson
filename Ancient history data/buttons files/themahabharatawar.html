            <p>The Mahabharata War, also known as the Kurukshetra War, is one of the most epic battles described in Indian history and mythology. Fought between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, it represents the eternal struggle between dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness). This 18-day battle took place on the plains of Kurukshetra and shaped the moral and spiritual values of ancient India.</p>

            <p>The war began with Duryodhana's refusal to return the Pandavas' rightful kingdom, leading to a catastrophic conflict. Key moments include Arjuna's hesitation on the battlefield, Krishna's divine guidance through the Bhagavad Gita, and the heroic battles fought by warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Abhimanyu.</p>
