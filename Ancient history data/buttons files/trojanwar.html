            <p>The Trojan War, a legendary conflict between the Greeks and the city of Troy, is one of the most iconic events in ancient Greek mythology. Believed to have occurred in the 12th or 13th century BCE, the war is immortalized in Homer's epic poems, the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.</p>

            <p>According to legend, the war began after Paris, a prince of Troy, abducted Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaus. This act prompted the Greek city-states, led by King Agamemnon, to launch a massive expedition to retrieve Helen and lay siege to Troy.</p>

            <p>After a decade-long siege, the Greeks devised a cunning strategy involving the famous Trojan Horse. Pretending to retreat, they left a giant wooden horse outside Troy's gates. Hidden inside were Greek soldiers who emerged at night, opening the gates and allowing the Greek army to sack the city.</p>
