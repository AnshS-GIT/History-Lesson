                Buddhism and Jainism emerged as significant religious movements in ancient India during the 6th century BCE. Both religions challenged the ritualistic practices and social inequalities prevalent in Vedic traditions, offering alternative spiritual paths focused on non-violence, self-discipline, and liberation.

                Jainism was founded by Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, who emphasized strict non-violence (Ahimsa), truthfulness, and asceticism. Similarly, Buddhism, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha), focused on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as a means to end suffering and achieve Nirvana.

                Both religions spread rapidly across the Indian subcontinent and beyond, influencing art, culture, and philosophy. Monuments like the Sanchi Stupa and Jain temples at Mount Abu stand as enduring symbols of their legacy.
